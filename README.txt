<strong>Sales Booster GD - Show recent sales popups on your website & Build trust in your Business</strong>

Sales Booster GD is a plugin that deserves all your attention.  We dare to call it "the most beneficial tool you will ever install in your online store!" Maybe our view is a little subjective but we have good reason to believe what we say.  If you are looking for an effective tool for your store, one that will gain your customers` trust and boost your sales you arrived in the right place.

<strong>Why do we say that?? What is Sales Booster GD?</strong>

It is an amazing tool that runs the recent sales from the website in popups, works seamlessly, and has an  eye catching interference. Doing a simple thing, like automatically display pop-ups of the recently bought items, will turn your hesitant visitors into buyers. Just think about it: a client enters for the first time on your online store and he doesn't know if he can trust it or not. But then he sees these nice popup-ups with other people and their items purchased from your website. 

And the magic happens! "Social Proof"  is call!  These notifications will have a positive impact on the purchase decision by making your potential clients  more confident and increasing their intention to buy from you. 

The idea is that people trust other users reviews or actions because they have experienced it, unlike themselves. It is a psychological and social phenomenon to count on others' ratings and actions. It demonstrates a simple thing: someone else bought it from there and it`s ok to do the same. It's not something you would do too??? 

Even in every-day life, we all do it, we all read reviews to make up our mind on a product!  

Now you understand why we say it?? With just a few clicks, you will make your online store lively and gain your customers` trust.
